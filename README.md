# AnalogSelector Library for Arduino

This library provides an easy and robust way to read a potentiometer or other analog input as a multi-selector switch.

## Getting Started

```cpp
AnalogSelector selector(Pin, NumPositions);

void setup() {
	selector.begin();
}

void loop() {
	int option = selector.getPosition();
}
```
